# CHIMERA: CHapel Interval MEthods libRAry


A library for interval arithmetic and applications in Chapel.

**NOTE**: very very experimental and preliminary, as you probably deduced by this readme.

## Why the name

A chimera is a mythological hybrid creature. Generally, computational mathematics aims at giving approximate results while pure maths is interested in rigorous proofs.
Interval arithmetic is in a way a chimera, it allows to perform numerical computations but it is also rigorous (if well implemented) and allows to actually perform proofs
with floating point numbers. To name a few success stories, both the [Kepler conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture) open for 300 years and [Smale 14th problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smale%27s_problems) were proved with interval arithmetic.
